Created CRUD API end points for emplyee using python falcon framework. 
I have not used any Database(SQL, Mysql, MongoDB) now because of limited time. All the data will be created in files.
One file will be created for one employee. 
I have handled all the exceptions and depeloped the application in such a way the we can add more endpoints easily.
If the requirement is to integrate the databases like SQL, Mysql, please let me know, I will integrate it and send it back.

Main points:
1. Log messages
    - added log messages for each request and response
    - added log message for each error

2. Exceptions
    - handled all the exceptions and each exception logs the error internally.

3. Middlewares
    - created req-resp log Middleware
    - created authentication Middleware

4. User friendly messages and error message

5. Request body validation
    - length validation
    - range validation
    - pattern matching validation
    - data type validation
